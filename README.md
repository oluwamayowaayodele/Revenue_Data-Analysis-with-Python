## Revenue-Data-Analysis-with-Python

While this was prompted by a straightforward question concerning how I'd ordinarialy clean data (to which I responded that it really depends what BI software/platform you're using), this piece has come about by complete chance. Quite simply, I was mistakenly sent a technical test for a mid-senior analyst role. The data looked good enough to work with, so I thought I'd make my way through it. It's not complete all in one go as I haven't had any real stretch of time at all to dedicate to it so I'll be finishing it up when I can sit down with it. It will probably look a lot less polished like this but I actually prefer that. The questions look straightforward though.


### Questions

#### Question 1

##### How many female users are in the dataset?

For all users with missing gender information, please set the gender field to the most common gender in the dataset.

### Question 2

##### What is the mean revenue generated per user (ie across all dates)?

### Question 3

##### Compare the mean and the median revenue generated per user.

How do you interpret the results of these calculations?

### Question 4

##### Please visualise the distribution of the revenues per user.

### Question 5

##### What is the average revenue generated per user in the first week?

Merge the two datasets and calculate the days since registration for each user and date in the activity table. Please consider all revenue generated in the first 7 days after registration for each user.

### Question 6

##### In this dataset men generated a higher revenue than women, on average. In which country is this difference biggest?

### Question 7

##### Please visualise the relationship between country, gender and revenue in the first week with an appropriate chart.

### Question 8

##### Is this difference in revenue between men and women statistically significant? (Yes / No)

Please use a significance level of 5% and an appropriate statistical test.

### Question 9

##### Please predict the revenue of a new user.

Build a linear regression model and predict the revenue generated in the first week for a user based on the following variables: Gender, AgeGroup and Country. Please do not use any higher order or interaction terms.

The AgeGroup variable should group the age of each user into one of the following bins: Less than 25years, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50, 60-65 and 65+.

What revenue in week 1 do you predict for a female customer from the US aged 30 - 35?

### Question 10

##### Is the country of the customer statistically significant when predicting the revenue? (Yes / No)

Please use a significance level of 0.1.
